        <input type="hidden" id="burgos-text" value="Located midway between San Fernando City and Baguio City, Burgos is an hour away from both the brilliant beaches of La Union and the pine forests of the Cordilleras. While it is mainly a transit destination, Burgos has wonders of its own such as the Bolikewkew Rice Terraces, Imelda Lake, and Dalacdac Dam. Travelers will find hiking among Burgos’ lush foliage a refreshing one, as the town has the coolest climate in the province.<br/><br/>Tapey (rice wine), binudbudan (a native delicacy), pineapples, bananas, and other fruits are the main offerings in the town’s market. Also on display are bamboo and basket handicrafts. Undoubtedly, the best souvenir to take home is Burgos’ famed colored soft brooms. Colorful arrays of these can easily be spotted on stalls along the Baguio-Bauang Highway where one can witness soft broom making demonstrations. The town’s plain and colored brooms are widely sold in Baguio and even Metro Manila. To rectify the misconception among buyers that the brooms are exclusively made in Baguio, all makers have been required to mark their products with the name of Burgos. The brooms’ prominence in the town’s livelihood is further illustrated during the annual Boyboy Festival held every February 21-23.<br/><br/>Burgos was named in honor of the martyr Father Jose Burgos who, while fleeing from the Spaniards, stopped by to officiate a mass in Sitio Domingo, Barangay Agpay."/>
